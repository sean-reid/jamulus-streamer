# Jamulus Streamer
Instantly set up a private Jamulus server in GCP, and effortlessly stream your jam sessions to YouTube Live!

## About
[Jamulus](https://jamulus.io) is a popular open-source software that allows musicians to join online, low-latency jam sessions.

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) is... well, you know. Youtube.

What do you do if you want to stream a private online jam session to YouTube Live with low latency? The current workflow is complicated, and not very well documented. This project was created to make low-latency jam session streaming as easy as 1, 2, 3:
1. Setup your environment
2. Deploy and configure server in GCP
3. Stream audio from server to YouTube

```

```
